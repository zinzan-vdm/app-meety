                    <strong>{siteConfig.name}</strong> is a menu-bar app for{" "}
                    {siteConfig.platform}. When a meeting starts it records your system
                    audio and your microphone as two independent streams, transcribes them
                    on-device, and writes one markdown note per meeting into a vault path
                    you choose. No meeting bot joins the call. There is no Google OAuth
                    and no Microsoft Graph. {siteConfig.name} watches your calendar and
                    audio devices locally through EventKit.

                <p>
                    The promise is simple. On the default path your audio never leaves
                    your machine. Local transcription with <code>whisper.cpp</code> is the
                    primary path, on-device diarization separates voices, and the notes
                    are plain markdown files you can read, edit, search, and back up with
                    any tool. {siteConfig.name} is{" "}

                        <strong>Two-stream capture.</strong> System audio and the
                        microphone are recorded as separate streams. The microphone track
                        is always labelled You.

                        attendees, duration, model, and source.

                        memories over stdio. No cloud, no proxy.

                    {siteConfig.name} runs in your menu bar and watches for meetings. When
                    one starts it captures system audio and your microphone, transcribes
                    the audio on-device, separates the speakers, and writes a finished
                    markdown note into your vault. The vault is just a folder of files.
                    From there your notes are searchable on disk, readable in any editor,
                    and reachable by MCP-aware tools through the local server.
