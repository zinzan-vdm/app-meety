                    {siteConfig.name} is a menu-bar app. After you install it, it lives in
                    the macOS menu bar rather than the Dock, and it watches your calendar
                    and audio devices through EventKit. There is no window to keep open
                    and no bot that joins your calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the first run, macOS prompts for two permissions. It asks for{" "}
                    <strong>microphone</strong> access so {siteConfig.name} can record
                    your voice, and for <strong>screen recording</strong> access, which is
                    required to capture system audio from the other participants. Grant
                    both. Without screen recording permission, the system-audio stream
                    cannot be captured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    {siteConfig.name} also downloads its model weights once on first use,
                    the first time it transcribes or diarizes locally. After that the
                    on-device path works without a network connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, choose a <strong>vault path</strong>. This is the folder
                    where {siteConfig.name} writes one markdown file per meeting. Point it
                    at a plain directory, an existing notes folder, or anywhere you
                    already back up. The files are ordinary markdown, so any editor or
                    sync tool can read them.

                    all-party consent. {siteConfig.name} gives you the tool. Obtaining

                    {siteConfig.name} captures two independent streams for every meeting.
                    One is the system audio of everyone else on the call. The other is
                    your microphone. Keeping them separate is what makes accurate speaker
                    labels possible later.

                    The default transcription path is local. {siteConfig.name} bundles

                    For long meetings, the OpenAI Whisper API is available as an opt-in
                    fallback for faster cloud transcription. It needs an OpenAI key, and
                    you turn it on yourself. It is never the default, and the local path

                    or diarization, and the opt-in cloud-AI and webhook paths are the only
                    others. All of them can be blocked. Notes are also encrypted at rest
                    with AES-256-GCM and Argon2id, and {siteConfig.name} ships no
                    telemetry, analytics, or crash reporting.
