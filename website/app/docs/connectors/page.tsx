                    The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that lets an
                    application expose context and tools to an AI client through a small,
                    well-defined interface. A client connects to a server, lists the tools
                    it offers, and calls them on demand. The protocol does not require a
                    network. A server can run as a local process and speak to the client
                    over standard input and output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    {siteConfig.name} ships a local MCP server named{" "}
                    <code>folio-mcp</code>. It gives any MCP-aware tool{" "}
                    <strong>read-only</strong> access to your transcripts, tasks, and
                    memories over <code>stdio</code>. There is no cloud and no proxy. The
                    server runs on your machine, reads from your vault, and answers the
                    client directly. The one exception is <code>create_task</code>, which
                    writes a new task back into your vault.

                        over standard input and output. A minimal configuration registers
                        a single server named <code>folio</code> with the command{" "}
                        <code>folio-mcp</code> and an empty argument list.
