# Meety's brand promise: "no telemetry, logs are local." Once a
# Mixpanel / PostHog / Sentry / etc. lands in the lock files it is
# very hard to extricate — packages bleed transitive dependencies
# that import the SDK lazily. The cheapest defence is a CI check that
# greps the locks before a dirty package can land.
#
# Exit non-zero on any hit. Run from the repo root.
